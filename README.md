# Analysing-unicorn-companies

Project Description:

Which industries are booming? Where should your next investment be? With the rise of the ‘amateur investor’ and the availability of platforms enabling people to invest and sell stock in public companies, it’s never been a better time to understand the financial performance of companies across the globe!
In this Datacamp project PostgreSQL is used to query and identify the top performing industries that have the most number of unicorn companies being created.
